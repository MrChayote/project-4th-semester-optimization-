## Visualizing 3D Models

To visualize the 3D models in this project, you will need to download the [Kenney's Brick Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/brick-kit).

Once downloaded, please locate the `.obj` files within the extracted Brick Kit. These `.obj` files are used by GitHub's 3D file viewer to display the individual pieces of the project.

**Steps:**

1.  Go to [https://kenney.nl/assets/brick-kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/brick-kit) and download the asset pack.
2.  Extract the contents of the downloaded archive (e.g., `.zip` file).
3.  Within the extracted folders in to the Godot proyect whit the name "Datos", an , find the `.obj` files representing the different brick pieces.

By including these `.obj` files in the repository, users will be able to view interactive 3D representations of the building blocks directly in their web browser on GitHub.
