# LEGO Bridge Simulation Project 🚗🌉

This repository contains a simulation project developed using the Godot game engine. The goal is to find the optimal configuration of LEGO-like pieces to build a bridge that allows a firetruck to cross safely, considering physical forces such as gravity, weight, and velocity.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository includes several branches, each with a different format of the project:

### 🔹 [`Files-Godot-game` branch](https://github.com/MrChayote/project-4th-semester-optimization-/tree/Files-Godot-game)
This branch contains the Godot project with all files uploaded individually. It is ideal for reviewing and editing specific parts of the simulation.

### 🔹 [`Godot-file` branch](https://github.com/MrChayote/project-4th-semester-optimization-/tree/Godot-file)
This branch contains the entire project bundled in a single `.zip` file. Recommended if you want to download and run the simulation quickly in the Godot editor.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project simulates a 3D environment where bridge structures are created using LEGO-like blocks. An evolutionary algorithm is used to optimize these structures so that a firetruck can cross from one mountain to another.

Each "individual" (bridge candidate) is evaluated based on:
- Structural stability
- Number of pieces used
- Whether the firetruck successfully crosses the bridge (`test passed`)

More technical details can be found in the [`Parcial 2 IB.pdf`](https://github.com/MrChayote/project-4th-semester-optimization-/blob/main/Parcial%202%20IB.pdf) file.

## 📌 Notes

- The [`main` branch](https://github.com/MrChayote/project-4th-semester-optimization-/tree/main) serves as an index for the project.
- To explore or run the simulation, switch to one of the branches listed above.
