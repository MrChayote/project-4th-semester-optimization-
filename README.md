# LEGO Bridge Simulation Project 🚗🌉

This repository contains a simulation project developed in the Godot engine. The goal is to find the optimal configuration of LEGO-like pieces to build a bridge that allows a firetruck to cross safely, using realistic physics such as gravity, weight, and speed.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository includes multiple branches with different versions of the Godot project:

### 🔹 Branch: `Files-Godot-game`
This branch contains the Godot project with all files uploaded individually. It is useful if you want to explore or modify specific parts of the project.

### 🔹 Branch: `Godot-file`
This branch contains a single `.zip` file with the complete Godot project. It's recommended if you want to quickly download and run the simulation in Godot.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The project simulates a 3D environment where bridge structures are built using LEGO-style blocks. An evolutionary algorithm is used to find the best configuration that allows a firetruck to cross the bridge without collapsing.

Each individual (bridge design) is evaluated based on:

- Structural stability
- Number of pieces used
- Whether the test (bridge crossing) was completed successfully

More technical details are explained in the file `Parcial 2 IB.pdf` located in the main branch.

## 📌 Notes

- The `main` branch serves as an index and does not contain the full simulation.
- Switch to one of the other branches to access the full Godot project.
